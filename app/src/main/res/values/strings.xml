    <string name="answer_emp1">
        Simply click on the table which you want to make the order for
        and you will be redirected to the order screen.
    </string>

    <string name="answer_emp2">
        Tables\' status change automatically when the order is taken (yellow color)
        and then when the order is delivered (green color) and finally back to grey when
        the table has no active customers.
    </string>

    <string name="answer_emp3">
        A notification will appear on your phone screen letting you know which order
        is ready to be served.
    </string>

    <string name="answer_emp4">
        Well thats unfortunate!\nDon\'t worry you can still use the same account just click the option "Leave workspace"
        in your settings and you will be redirected to a new page where you can join your new store
        that you are working.
